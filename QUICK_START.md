## 🌍 How the Language Selector Works:

When visitors click the language selector (🌐), they can choose any of 12 languages:
- If you've translated that language → Shows full website
- If not translated yet → Shows "Coming Soon" page with link back to English

This is PROFESSIONAL - many big companies launch with 1-3 languages and add more over time!

- Verify files uploaded correctly

**Language links not working?**
- Normal! Those pages show "Coming Soon" until you translate them
